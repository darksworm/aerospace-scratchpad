## Scratchpad Workspace Issue

- When summoning a scratchpad that is stuck on a different workspace (didn't send it back to its home after using it), it doesn't work until I send it back to its home workspace first.
- Scratchpads summoned to multiple different screens sometimes don't resize properly.
- We should be able to specify the positioning of scratchpads - fx. when I use finder, I want it to go to the bottom of the screen, not the middle, because I'm probably dragging something from it.
